# BU Spark! Hackathon - FastAPI

The website: [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

In plain terms, FastAPI is a python library that enables a Python application to act act as an HTTP (mostly) server for producing dynamic responses to requests. A FastAPI enabled application is used to build APIs with Python and a standard type hint. It is used to specifically create RESTful APIs. It also provides automation for producing documentation for the service you created. Itâ€™s currently used by Uber, Microsoft, Explosion AI and others.

Key Features

* **Built-in Security**: Fast API provides built-in security mechanisms through features like **validation** and **sanitization** of user input and dependency injection for various authentication mechanisms.
* **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of **concurrent** requests and is ideal to be used for real-time applications.
* Automatic Data Validation: **Data validation** ensures that the data (input and output) matches predefined structures and FastAPI provides an automatic data validation mechanism which is much faster than traditional manual validation. Integrated with **Pydantic models**. These models use Python-type annotations which help validate the requests and responses to and from the API.
* High Performance: FastAPI is a modern framework which provides performance at par with NodeJS and Go
* **type hints**
* **asynchronous support**, easy to handle asynchronous operations and I/O-bound tasks.
* Automatically generates detailed and user-friendly **error messages**. By default, FastAPI displays error messages in JSON format.
* In-built automatic documentation support. It helps provide a UI for testing your service. To access these automatically generated documentation, hit the endpoint of the API that has to be tested with /docs.


## Local

```sh
# Create an '/app' directory
mkdir /app
# Change directory into '/app' directory
cd /app
# Update the installed software and add the 'vim' editor, just in case
apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade && apt-get install -y vim
# Update python library manager (pip) to latest version
pip install --upgrade pip
# Install 'fastapi' library
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
# Create a basic server with two routes
cat << EOF > main.py
from typing import Union
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}


@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
EOF

# Start the server, for any client, on port 8001
fastapi dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 main.py

```

To try the above script, start up a latest `python` image, and copy paste the above lines

`docker run -it --rm --name buspark-app -p 8001:8001 python /bin/bash`

To test your first server, from your own machine open a browser at

[http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/)

### For DigitalOcean

```sh
# Update the latest mirrors
apt update
# Add the 'vi' editor
apt install -y vim
# Add 'pip' module, to manage libraries
apt install -y python3-pip
# Add the 'venv' module, to manage virtual environments
apt install python3.12-venv
# Create a virtual environment (subdirectory)
python3 -m venv venv
# Switch to the virtual environment in 'venv' subdirectory
source venv/bin/activate
# Add the 'fastapi' library to the virtual environment
pip install "fastapi[standard]"

nohup fastapi dev --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 main.py &

```


### Notes

Flask is a synchronous app server enabling library. It is worth knowing and the below comparison can help evaluate the benefits of each implementation.

[Swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) is the SmartBear developed de-facto standard for API development. They provide tools and maintain up-to-date standard compliant utilities to speed up API development. 

[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) is the basic architectural principle that drives current/common API implementations. The patterns included and the standards based on it are quite useful for all sorts of projects.
